# Who Ate My Ka7k?

# Story:

You buy a box of ka7k on Eid night and wait patiently for morning to eat them. Unfortunately, you wake up to find them all gone.

You are on a mission to find your ka7k, while learning some handy bash commands along the way.

# How to play:

- Clone this repo.

  `git clone git@github.com:Open-Source-Community/WhoStoleMyKa7k.git`

- _In a bash shell_, go to the game folder.

  `cd WhoStoleMyKa7k`

  The game has not been tested in other shells, but should be playable. However, some commands may not work as expected.

- Run the start script to enable `cheat` command.

  `source ./start.sh`

  Note: this script will not work in zsh.

- Run `cheat` from anywhere in the game to bring up a bash command cheat-sheet.

  Note: the `cheat` command will not work in zsh.

- Explore the game folders and files with your newly equipped commands!
