# Full plot (spoilers!):
After waking up, you go around the house room by room looking for the ka7k. 

In the bedroom, you find your closet messy, so you go on a side quest to tidy it. (mv)


In the living room, ???

In the kitchen, you find  a bag of trash and you throw it (rm -r). You look in the pantry and cupboards, and find some expired items. You throw them as well. (rm)

You can't find the ka7k at first, but you decide to search one more time (ls -l). You find the box hidden in the pantry! But you also find the ka7k monster.

~~The monster threatens to eat all your ka7k, and starts eating them. You have to kill it quickly before it eats all your ka7k. (rm)~~

~~(Script that loops on the ka7k files and deletes them with a delay, and stops when the monster is deleted)~~

~~After you kill the monster, the game ends. It shows all the missions you completed and the number of ka7k you managed to save from the monster.~~

Surprise happy ending! No kahk monsters are harmed in this version.
