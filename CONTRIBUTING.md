If you want to contribute to the game, you are welcome to work on existing issues or create a new issue to work on.

If you simply want to suggest an idea, you can create an issue describing it and it will be reviewed shortly. Approved ideas will be implemented in the future (by us or another kind contributor!).

### Improving task descriptions

- If you find a certain task unclear or difficult to finish with the help of the given cheat-sheet alone, you can either:
  - Improve on the cheat-sheet
  - Try to make the description clearer
- Create a git branch named _[task\_name]\_improvement_ (eg: _pantry_task_improvement_)

- Implement the improvement and create a pull request.

- Create an issue describing the proposed improvement, and link your pull request to the issue.

### Creating new levels

- Create a git branch named as your new area (eg: _dining_room_)

- Create files and folders to complete the scene

- Add ASCII art to objects.

  - If you want to add an existing character, please copy it from within the game for consistency.
  - If it's a new character, be as creative as you want to be!

- If your level includes a task/side-quest, write a script that validates completion. Test this script in all cases (completed, not started, partially completed, etc.)

- Create a pull request with a description of the level and tasks (if any)

- Create an issue describing the proposed improvement, and link your pull request to the issue.
